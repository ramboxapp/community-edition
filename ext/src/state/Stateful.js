    /**
     * @cfg {Boolean} stateful
     * A flag which causes the object to attempt to restore the state of
     * internal properties from a saved state on startup. The object must have
     * a {@link #stateId} for state to be managed.
     *
     * Auto-generated ids are not guaranteed to be stable across page loads and
     * cannot be relied upon to save and restore the same state for a object.
     *
     * For state saving to work, the state manager's provider must have been
     * set to an implementation of {@link Ext.state.Provider} which overrides the
     * {@link Ext.state.Provider#set set} and {@link Ext.state.Provider#get get}
     * methods to save and recall name/value pairs. A built-in implementation,
     * {@link Ext.state.CookieProvider} is available.
     *
     * To set the state provider for the current page:
     *
     *    Ext.state.Manager.setProvider(new Ext.state.CookieProvider({
     *        expires: new Date(new Date().getTime()+(1000*60*60*24*7)), //7 days from now
     *    }));
     *
     * A stateful object attempts to save state when one of the events
     * listed in the {@link #stateEvents} configuration fires.
     *
     * To save state, a stateful object first serializes its state by
     * calling *{@link #getState}*.
     *
     * The Component base class implements {@link #getState} to save its width and height within the state
     * only if they were initially configured, and have changed from the configured value.
     *
     * The Panel class saves its collapsed state in addition to that.
     *
     * The Grid class saves its column state and store state (sorters and filters and grouper) in addition to its superclass state.
     *
     * If there is more application state to be save, the developer must provide an implementation which
     * first calls the superclass method to inherit the above behaviour, and then injects new properties
     * into the returned object.
     *
     * The value yielded by getState is passed to {@link Ext.state.Manager#set}
     * which uses the configured {@link Ext.state.Provider} to save the object
     * keyed by the {@link #stateId}.
     *
     * During construction, a stateful object attempts to *restore* its state by calling
     * {@link Ext.state.Manager#get} passing the {@link #stateId}
     *
     * The resulting object is passed to {@link #applyState}*. The default implementation of
     * {@link #applyState} simply copies properties into the object, but a developer may
     * override this to support restoration of more complex application state.
     *
     * You can perform extra processing on state save and restore by attaching
     * handlers to the {@link #beforestaterestore}, {@link #staterestore},
     * {@link #beforestatesave} and {@link #statesave} events.
