/**
 * This class manages state information for a component or element during a layout.
 * 
 * # Blocks
 *
 * A "block" is a required value that is preventing further calculation. When a layout has
 * encountered a situation where it cannot possibly calculate results, it can associate
 * itself with the context item and missing property so that it will not be rescheduled
 * until that property is set.
 * 
 * Blocks are a one-shot registration. Once the property changes, the block is removed.
 * 
 * Be careful with blocks. If *any* further calculations can be made, a block is not the
 * right choice.
 * 
 * # Triggers
 *
 * Whenever any call to {@link #getProp}, {@link #getDomProp}, {@link #hasProp} or
 * {@link #hasDomProp} is made, the current layout is automatically registered as being
 * dependent on that property in the appropriate state. Any changes to the property will
 * trigger the layout and it will be queued in the {@link Ext.layout.Context}.
 *
 * Triggers, once added, remain for the entire layout. Any changes to the property will
 * reschedule all unfinished layouts in their trigger set.
