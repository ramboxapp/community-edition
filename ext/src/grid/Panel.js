/**
 * Grids are an excellent way of showing large amounts of tabular data on the client side.
 * Essentially a supercharged `<table>`, GridPanel makes it easy to fetch, sort and filter
 * large amounts of data.
 *
 * Grids are composed of two main pieces - a {@link Ext.data.Store Store} full of data and
 * a set of columns to render.
 *
 * ## Basic GridPanel
 *
 *     @example
 *     Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
 *         storeId: 'simpsonsStore',
 *         fields:[ 'name', 'email', 'phone'],
 *         data: [
 *             { name: 'Lisa', email: 'lisa@simpsons.com', phone: '555-111-1224' },
 *             { name: 'Bart', email: 'bart@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1234' },
 *             { name: 'Homer', email: 'homer@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1244' },
 *             { name: 'Marge', email: 'marge@simpsons.com', phone: '555-222-1254' }
 *         ]
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         title: 'Simpsons',
 *         store: Ext.data.StoreManager.lookup('simpsonsStore'),
 *         columns: [
 *             { text: 'Name', dataIndex: 'name' },
 *             { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email', flex: 1 },
 *             { text: 'Phone', dataIndex: 'phone' }
 *         ],
 *         height: 200,
 *         width: 400,
 *         renderTo: Ext.getBody()
 *     });
 *
 * The code above produces a simple grid with three columns. We specified a Store which
 * will load JSON data inline.
 * In most apps we would be placing the grid inside another container and wouldn't need to
 * use the {@link #height}, {@link #width} and {@link #renderTo} configurations but they
 * are included here to make it easy to get up and running.
 *
 * The grid we created above will contain a header bar with a title ('Simpsons'), a row of
 * column headers directly underneath and finally the grid rows under the headers.
 *
 * **Height config with bufferedRenderer: true**
 *
 * The {@link #height} config must be set when creating a grid using
 * {@link #bufferedRenderer bufferedRenderer}: true _and_ the grid's height is not managed
 * by an owning container layout.  In Ext JS 5.x bufferedRendering is true by default.
 *
 * ## Configuring columns
 *
 * By default, each column is sortable and will toggle between ASC and DESC sorting when
 * you click on its header. Each column header is also reorderable by default, and each
 * gains a drop-down menu with options to hide and show columns.  It's easy to configure
 * each column - here we use the same example as above and just modify the columns config:
 *
 *     columns: [
 *         {
 *             text: 'Name',
 *             dataIndex: 'name',
 *             sortable: false,
 *             hideable: false,
 *             flex: 1
 *         },
 *         {
 *             text: 'Email',
 *             dataIndex: 'email',
 *             hidden: true
 *         },
 *         {
 *             text: 'Phone',
 *             dataIndex: 'phone',
 *             width: 100
 *         }
 *     ]
 *
 * We turned off sorting and hiding on the 'Name' column so clicking its header now has no
 * effect. We also made the Email column hidden by default (it can be shown again by using
 * the menu on any other column). We also set the Phone column to a fixed with of 100px
 * and flexed the Name column, which means it takes up all remaining width after the other
 * columns have been accounted for. See the {@link Ext.grid.column.Column column docs} for
 * more details.
 *
 * ## Renderers
 *
 * As well as customizing columns, it's easy to alter the rendering of individual cells
 * using renderers. A renderer is tied to a particular column and is passed the value that
 * would be rendered into each cell in that column. For example, we could define a
 * renderer function for the email column to turn each email address into a mailto link:
 *
 *     columns: [
 *         {
 *             text: 'Email',
 *             dataIndex: 'email',
 *             renderer: function(value) {
 *                 return Ext.String.format('<a href="mailto:{0}">{1}</a>', value, value);
 *             }
 *         }
 *     ]
 *
 * See the {@link Ext.grid.column.Column column docs} for more information on renderers.
 *
 * ## Selection Models
 *
 * Sometimes you simply want to render data for viewing, but usually it's
 * necessary to interact with or update that data. Grids use a concept called a Selection
 * Model, which is simply a mechanism for selecting some part of the data in the grid. The
 * two main types of Selection Model are RowSelectionModel, where entire rows are
 * selected, and CellSelectionModel, where individual cells are selected.
 *
 * Grids use a Row Selection Model by default, but this is easy to customize like so:
 *
 *     Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         selModel: 'cellmodel',
 *         store: ...
 *     });
 *
 *
 * Specifying the `cellmodel` changes a couple of things. Firstly, clicking on a cell now
 * selects just that cell (using a {@link Ext.selection.RowModel rowmodel} will select the
 * entire row), and secondly the keyboard navigation will walk from cell to cell instead 
 * of row to row. Cell-based selection models are usually used in conjunction with
 * editing.
 *
 * You may also utilize selModel as a config object for an instance of {@link Ext.selection.Model}.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *     selModel: {
 *         selType: 'cellmodel',
 *         mode   : 'MULTI'
 *     }
 *
 * This allows you to modify additional selection model configurations such as:
 *
 * + {@link Ext.selection.Model#mode mode} - Specifies whether user may select multiple
 * rows or single rows
 * + {@link Ext.selection.Model#allowDeselect allowDeselect} - Specifies whether user may
 * deselect records (when in SINGLE mode)
 * + {@link Ext.selection.Model#ignoreRightMouseSelection ignoreRightMouseSelection} - Specifies
 * whether user may ignore right clicks
 * for selection purposes
 *
 * ## Sorting & Filtering
 *
 * Every grid is attached to a {@link Ext.data.Store Store}, which provides multi-sort and
 * filtering capabilities. It's
 * easy to set up a grid to be sorted from the start:
 *
 *     var myGrid = Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         store: {
 *             fields: ['name', 'email', 'phone'],
 *             sorters: ['name', 'phone']
 *         },
 *         columns: [
 *             { text: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name' },
 *             { text: 'Email', dataIndex: 'email' }
 *         ]
 *     });
 *
 * Sorting at run time is easily accomplished by simply clicking each column header. If
 * you need to perform sorting on more than one field at run time it's easy to do so by
 * adding new sorters to the store:
 *
 *     myGrid.store.sort([
 *         { property: 'name',  direction: 'ASC' },
 *         { property: 'email', direction: 'DESC' }
 *     ]);
 *
 * See {@link Ext.data.Store} for examples of filtering.
 *
 * ## State saving
 *
 * When configured {@link #stateful}, grids save their column state (order and width)
 * encapsulated within the default Panel state of changed width and height and
 * collapsed/expanded state.
 *
 * Each {@link #columns column} of the grid may be configured with a
 * {@link Ext.grid.column.Column#stateId stateId} which identifies that column locally
 * within the grid.
 *
 * ## Plugins and Features
 *
 * Grid supports addition of extra functionality through features and plugins:
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.plugin.CellEditing CellEditing} - editing grid contents one cell at a time.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.plugin.RowEditing RowEditing} - editing grid contents an entire row at a time.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.plugin.DragDrop DragDrop} - drag-drop reordering of grid rows.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.toolbar.Paging Paging toolbar} - paging through large sets of data.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.plugin.BufferedRenderer Infinite scrolling} - another way to handle large sets of data.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.RowNumberer RowNumberer} - automatically numbered rows.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.feature.Grouping Grouping} - grouping together rows having the same value in a particular field.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.feature.Summary Summary} - a summary row at the bottom of a grid.
 *
 * - {@link Ext.grid.feature.GroupingSummary GroupingSummary} - a summary row at the bottom of each group.
